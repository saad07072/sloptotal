# These constants were previously dead: score_to_verdict_str() in schemas.py had

# reads them, so there is one source of truth.
#
# Observed distributions after the reweighting, n=70 AI / 40 modern human /
# 26 literary human:
#
#                        p50    p75    p90    p95    max
#   modern human        19.7   25.5   36.6   49.2   59.9
#   literary 1532-1915   9.8   13.0   16.0   18.8   24.5
#   AI                  65.8   85.2   90.8   91.7   96.6
#
# Chosen so that:
#   - 90% of human text (both corpora) reads Clean:      < 30
#   - 90% of AI text reaches Suspicious or above:       >= 45
#   - "Likely AI-generated" is reserved for high confidence: >= 55
#     which measures 63% sensitivity at 98% specificity, with 0 of 26 literary
#     samples flagged at any threshold.
#
# Youden's J peaks at 40 (100% sensitivity, 94% specificity), but a false
# accusation costs a student or job applicant far more than a missed detection
# costs the checker, so the "Likely AI" line sits deliberately above the
# J-optimal point. The Suspicious band carries the difference: it alerts without
# asserting.

# Derived from measurement, not judgement — see tests/eval/FINDINGS.md.
# Corpora: 110 RAID samples across news/books/poetry/abstracts (70 AI from
# gpt4/chatgpt/llama-chat/mistral-chat, 40 human) plus 26 Project Gutenberg
# chunks published 1532-1915, where any high score is a false positive by
# construction. Measured 2026-07-25.
#
# weight is proportional to Somers' D (2*AUC - 1), multiplied by
# (1 - literary_bias) where literary_bias is mean(classics) - mean(modern
# human). TMR and BERT-tiny RAID are additionally damped 0.65x because they are
# RAID-trained and the corpus is RAID, so their AUC is optimistic.
#
# What changed, and why the old table was wrong:
#
#   fakespot     0.13 -> 0.033  AUC 0.999 but literary bias +0.533: it scored
#                               pre-1920 prose 0.645 vs 0.112 for modern human
#                               text. It also anchored the whole calibration, so
#                               that bias was amplified rather than averaged
#                               out. It is now one voice among many.
#   burstiness   0.09 -> 0.011  AUC 0.578, yet was joint-largest weight.
#   linguistic   0.08 -> 0.030  AUC 0.713.
#   log_rank     0.02 -> 0.059  AUC 0.909, zero literary bias.
#   gltr         0.03 -> 0.058  AUC 0.904, zero literary bias.
#   perplexity   0.02 -> 0.058  AUC 0.901, zero literary bias.

# The GPT-2 perplexity family was assumed to be what flags classics, the
# intuition being that GPT-2 has memorised the canon so it reads as maximally
# predictable. The data says the opposite: those engines score classics *lower*
# than modern human text and are among the most dependable in the ensemble.
#
